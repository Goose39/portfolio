            <p>Growing up in South Africa I have always been interested in technology. From the first time I used a computer, at the age of 9, and attempted to connect to the internet (using 56k dial-up modem). I was intrigued by the noise it made but fascinated by all the possibilities that technology provided. <br>
                <br>
                Once I was exposed to my first programming language (Delphi 7) in High School I quickly realized the value of being able to write code and create my own applications. <br>
                <br>
                While working in the online gaming and sports betting industry, I was able to get a real understanding of how to integrate a variety of technologies in order to provide customers with online services. <br>
                <br>
                I am excited about the journey of moving from a user of technology, to implementing the development skills I have acquired over the years and becoming a creator of that technology. <br>
                <br>
                On days when I am not honing my development skills, you would find me giving my brain a break on the golf course where I am playing off a 2 handicap.
